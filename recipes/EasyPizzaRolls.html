<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Somewhere between a pizza slice and a garlic knot, these pizza rolls make for a great appetizer! Make it your own by swapping in your favorite pizza toppings. Serve with warmed marinara or more pizza sauce for dipping!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
<li>1 (13.8 ounce) can refrigerated pizza dough (such as Pillsbury®)</li>
<li>1 cup pizza sauce or marinara sauce</li>
<li>6 large slices deli pepperoni</li>
<li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
<li>10 thin small slices pepperoni</li>
<li>¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
<li>Garlic Parsley Oil</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray two cake pans with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
<li>Roll out pizza dough on a lightly floured cutting board. Flatten out into a rectangle.</li>
<li>Brush surface of the pizza dough with as much pizza sauce as you like.</li>
<li>Cover dough with alternating slices of large pepperoni and mozzarella slices. Dot with small pepperoni slices.</li>
<li>Starting at the long side, roll up the dough carefully into a jelly roll, making sure the filling stays in and pinch closed along the side. Slice into 1/2-inch rounds and place them inside the cake pans flat. Tuck the ends around as necessary and sprinkle Parmesan cheese over each slice.</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir together olive oil, parsley, and garlic in a shallow bowl. Brush warm pizza rolls with garlic oil.</li>
